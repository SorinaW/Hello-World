## What is this?

A free, interactive course that teaches you the economics behind successful SaaS companies — the same metrics VCs, CFOs, and board members use to evaluate businesses worth millions.

6 levels. Real company examples. Quiz-based progression.

## Why does this matter?

Warren Buffett is retiring in 2025. His parting wisdom?

> "The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power."

Whether you're **selling** SaaS or **building** it, understanding the underlying economics separates:
- Deals that close from deals that stall
- Startups that scale from startups that fail
- Features that matter from features that don't

**The problem:** 90% of SaaS professionals can't explain their own unit economics. They wonder why CFOs push back, why deals stall, and why competitors win.

**The solution:** Speak the language of the people who write the checks.
